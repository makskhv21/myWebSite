            <p>
                Hi! My name is Maksym Khvyts, and I am a junior front-end developer, a student 
                at the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute. Although I have no commercial 
                experience yet, I am passionate about growing in the web development field and 
                am always looking to improve my skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have skills in creating modern and visually appealing web interfaces. I quickly 
                absorb new information, enjoy learning, and am open to new challenges. I believe 
                that teamwork is a key component of success and am always ready to contribute to 
                collective achievements.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to join a professional team where I can contribute to creating high-quality digital products that solve real problems. 
                I’m confident that my enthusiasm and dedication to learning will be valuable assets to your company.
            </p>
